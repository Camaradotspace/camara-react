### v1.0.0-beta.9 (Sat Mar 27, 2021)

A change has been made to how the project gets updated. Going forward every new `beta` version is going to focus solely on a single component and try to improve on the component across its Storybook stories, docs, test, and real-world usage. This way I can move incrementally while knowing that I am thinking about each component in a comprehensive manner.

- `Button` component:
  - ❌ remove `primary` prop option for setting the type of button.
  - 🆕 `variant` prop is now used for setting the type of button from `primary`, `secondary` or `ghost`.
  - ✨ `size` prop now updated with `large`, `small` and `medium` options.
  - 🆕 `block` prop sets the option to fit button width to the full width of the parent
  - 🆕 `loading` prop add a loading spinner indicator to be used when users have to wait for the result of their action after pressing a button.
  - 🆕 `disabled` prop adds a visual indicator that a button is not interactive and restricts it from being pressed.
  - 🆕 `danger` prop adds a visual indicator that the button action is destructive and irreversible in some case
  - ❌ remove `orientation` prop.
  - ✨ rename `rounded` prop to `pill` to accurately describe the button shape

### v1.0.0-beta.6 (Wed Feb 03, 2021)

Rebuild from the ground-up. This changes everything!!!

- The previous bundler cli `microbundle` had a lot of issues with generating typescript definitions and wasn't flexible for me to modify its behavior.
  After loads of inconsistencies and mess I had to rewrite the core library to make use of rollup directly.
  This has made bundling the library much more solid and consistent than before. A lot has changed, I had to touch every single file but somehow keep the same APIs for each components.
  This lays a much more solid foundation for future version of Camara
